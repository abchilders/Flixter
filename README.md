### Notes

I had some difficulty adding shared element transitions to the app, as I had to take the extra step of converting context to type Activity before I could pass it to ActivityOptionsCompat.makeSceneTransitionAnimation. Additionally, I previously attempted to add rounded corners to images using Glide, but this caused the top and bottom margins of the poster images to expand significantly, so I removed this.

### Notes
I had some difficulties with an error reading "cannot get size() of null object." I set debugging breakpoints, checked LogCat, and 
rewatched the YouTube walkthroughs. It turns out I missed a few seconds of video where the presenter cuts and pastes a variable declaration
above a constructor using that variable without verbalizing that he was doing so.
